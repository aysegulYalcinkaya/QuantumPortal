                Ontology Fragment Bidding System

                <p>Development of the quantum ontology (QPhysO) is no small feat. It relies upon completion of the
                    physics ontology (PhysO), the mathematics ontology (MathEO), and others, underneath the
                    international standard (ISO/IEC 21838). The reason: the Quantum Ontology inherits from them. The
                    foundation for this has been established by Drs. Smith and Landgrebe, QMI Principals.</p>
                <p>We are soliciting volunteers with relevant niche areas of expertise in quantum science and
                    engineering, to contribute to the development of respective ontology fragments, from a list of ones
                    pending to-be-done. This portal has User Tiers. When users in the Ontology Developers Tier login,
                    their menu options include one to the user interface of this Ontology Fragment Bidding System.</p>
                <p>The old saying holds here: the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Experts can develop these
                    fragments, relatively easily, given their knowledge; these fragments become part of the quantum
                    ontology, and as such, have high impact on the advancement of quantum science and engineering. This
                    is explained in depth in a forthcoming book and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Development of these fragments require proper training. This training is provided free of charge to
                    those engaging in this ontology development initiative.</p>
                <p>Volunteers can elect to be paid, in money, or in points. If money, the expert simply enters a bid in
                    US dollars to be paid for the respective fragment, and a target completion date. If the bidder has
                    questions or comments, she can be entered it in a box on right-side of the bid entry fields (on the
                    portal page).</p>
                <p>If the bitter elects to earn points, instead of dollars, the bidder can commence with the effort
                    immediately. Otherwise, the bid goes to the QMI sponsors to decide on whether to fund it. </p>
                <p>Points can be applied to corporate sponsorship status, or other perks that are defined elsewhere.
                    Dollars are transferred electronically to the bidderâ€™s account. Both are transacted after delivery
                    and validation of the Ontology Fragment.</p>
