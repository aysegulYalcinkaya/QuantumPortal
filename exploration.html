                <p>Ease of use is key to the success of any system; we are exploring ways to make this portal as easy as
                    possible. For one, volunteers need to be able to easily understand where they can best contribute to
                    the on-going Quantum Ontology development, in context of their respective expertise and stakeholder
                    (funders) high-impact Quantum Use Cases. </p>
                <p>Stakeholders are another user group. Each group has somewhat unique requirements. We are exploring
                    ways to display of menu options match the user’s respective group functions upon login. For
                    Stakeholder the functions are primary precision search and matchups of their requests for
                    information (RFIs) with quantum providers prototypes and commercial products. </p>
                <p>We are also considering to option of providing portal functions in User Tiers, from basic data ingest
                    and editing, to a full system support. Users would be assigned a tier by system administrator, and
                    upon login the system would launch the respective functions of that tier. If assigned to the
                    Ontology developers tier, user would have access to a Workspace containing a full-function
                    development environment. </p>
                <p>We are also exploring the option of providing support to quantum scientists and engineers. This
                    portal is built on AWS, and as such has direct access to quantum computing via the <a
                            href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/features/" target="_blank">Bracket</a>.
                    This portal could also provide a somewhat complete library of quantum algorithms, and be potentially
                    free of charge for selected users, such as gifted students.</p>
                <p>When users in the Volunteers group login, their menu options can include access to our exploratory
                    Ontology Fragment Bidding System. This idea may seem strange to some, but what it offers makes it
                    worth considering, e.g., it matches user’s interests and expertise to parts of the Quantum Ontology
                    that remains to be completed, and those parts that a) will likely have most impact on the
                    advancement of quantum science and engineering, and b) the parts of the ontology most applicable to
                    supporting high priority stakeholder requirements. </p>
                <p>It is also important that volunteers be conveniently paid, in money, or in QMI points. Here is an
                    approach: if money, the expert simply enters a bid in US dollars to be paid for the respective
                    fragment, and a target completion date. If the bidder has questions or comments, she can be entered
                    it in a box on right-side of the bid entry fields (on the portal page). If the bitter elects to earn
                    points, instead of dollars, the bidder can commence with the effort immediately. Otherwise, the bid
                    goes to the QMI sponsors to decide on whether to fund it. Points can be applied to corporate
                    sponsorship status, or other perks that are defined elsewhere. Payments in dollars are transferred
                    electronically to the bidder’s account. Both are transacted after delivery and validation of the
                    Ontology Fragment. If the bidder has questions or comments, she can be entered it in a box on
                    right-side of the bid entry fields (on the portal page). If the bitter elects to earn points,
                    instead of dollars, the bidder can commence with the effort immediately. Otherwise, the bid goes to
                    the QMI sponsors to decide on whether to fund it. </p>
                <p>These exploratory activities are described elsewhere in more detail. What matters is that volunteers
                    are provided support for easily identifying, and developing, the remaining Quantum Ontology parts
                    within the scope of their knowledge, with as little effort and frustration as possible.</p>
